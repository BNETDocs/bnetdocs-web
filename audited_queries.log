The intruder attempted to cover their tracks, but didn\'t cover them all, which is how Kyro noticed them in the first place. When anything gets deleted, the content is put into a logs table as part of the logging documentation, but it looks like they deleted logs from the table too, just not all of their logs. I know this because the access logs show that they executed deletions on some logs, and the logs don\'t exist in the table when they clearly should.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I\'ve looked at the code a little closer and found SEVERAL security holes everywhere. I am uncomfortable with this after inheriting this website. To that end, I am committed to creating a newer website, with probably the same interface but at the very least a new core with far less security holes. To aid in any security holes that weren\'t found and I\'ve tried to patch, I have set the database user to read-only mode; so if a security hole is found and tried to be taken advantage of, at most is they will get to know how things look, but won\'t be able to modify or execute anything.\r\n\r\nThere will be two servers for the new website. The \"production\" server, which will be at <a href=\"http://dev.bnetdocs.org\">http://dev.bnetdocs.org</a>, and then also my \"local\" server, which won\'t be available to the public. The code will also be open-sourced, available at <a href=\"https://github.com/Jailout2000/bnetdocs-phoenix\">https://github.com/Jailout2000/bnetdocs-phoenix</a>. I\'ve already committed some code there if you wish to check it out, and the production server is also up and running with the code. I feel that having the code open-source won\'t be a security issue, since I am taking precautions to salt everything as well as provide options to change the hardcoded salts via a config file (so the real salt isn\'t available from the code necessarily).\r\n\r\nI have also disabled the 503 Service Unavailable error page so that bots and users alike will be happy visiting this website again (the notices and emails were pretty annoying).'

A solution was found which seems to have fixed the issue that was double encoding, however please make an effort to point out any encoding flaws if there are any. In an effort to remedy this permanently should it possibly happen in the future, a change was made to the Bnetdocs code that will set the encoding directly after connecting to mysql.\r\n\r\nIn another note, a couple of months ago Kyro noticed that there was a security intrusion to Bnetdocs which caused data to be deleted.

This was tedious, and also annoying for people who made use of the domain. \r\n\r\nBut now, that should be no longer an issue. I\'ve coded a script that\'ll automate the entire process. When a server goes down, the dementedminds.net server will identify the loss and automatically seek out the next available bnls server. Once one is found, it updates the DNS.\r\n\r\nIf you notice that the bnls.dementedminds.net redirector service isn\'t working for you, try the following troubleshooting steps (applicable for windows, if anyone can port those steps to the mac/*nix distros, feel free:\r\n\r\n1) Go into the command prompt, and type: ipconfig /flushdns\r\n\r\nThat should solve the problem, Windows tends to cache the DNS for servers recently accessed, so when the DNS is flushed, Windows will then query for the new DNS information. \r\n\r\n2) If that still doesn\'t work, check the right side of this website for the status of the servers:\r\n\r\n3) If the status indicates that the following servers are down:\r\n\r\n- valhallalegends.com\r\n- bnls.valhallalegends.com\r\n- jbls.org\r\n- hdx.jbls.org\r\n\r\nThen that pretty much means the redirector service ran out of alternate servers to redirect to. As soon as one of those alternate servers come back up, the redirector service will recognize it, and automatically redirect to that corresponding server. \r\n\r\n4) If the JBLS website indicates that one or more of the previously mentioned servers are up, give the bnls.dementedminds.net redirector service some time -- the service does a query every half hour to check the status of the servers, and as soon as it realizes the current server it has been redirecting to is down, it\'ll automatically seek out an alternate server and divert the flow to that server.\r\n\r\n5) If even after a half hour, bnls.dementedminds.net STILL isn\'t working (shouldn\'t ever happen, but you never know!), contact me and I\'ll check into it ASAP. \r\n\r\nHopefully the automated redirector service will help alleviate downtime of bots everywhere when a server goes down.\r\n\r\nP.S. \r\n\r\nAn user of bnls.dementedminds.net asked me about pings being redirected. Originally, pings were <b><u>NOT</u></b> redirected, only traffic for the BNLS ports were. But when he queried me about it, I thought it was a quite good idea, and have re-configured my server to from now on redirect all incoming pings to the server it is redirecting to. So in other words, all responses you receive from your pings to the bnls.dementedminds.net server are from the server it\'s redirecting to.
