# Blizzard CIDR Tracker
# (CIDR: Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
#
# These are IP address ranges collected from services such as ARIN and RIPE, or
# otherwise from Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) given to
# Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. or other interesting entities.
#
# This is meant to be a comprehensive list, regardless of their purpose
# (external/internal servers, offices/IT, etc.)
#
# Please assist BNETDocs by extending this list when you discover staleness or
# missing ranges, as well as by condensing any CIDRs where possible.
